# dungeons-dragons-data

The project looked to analyze a dataset via a Colab notebook completed for LIS4235 Scripting for Large Databases.

The scope of the project was to analyze a dataset that looked at the multiple fields in player character creation for the tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons and Dragons (DND). It was to look at some of the correlations between different choices players may make and what that may look like visualized in graphic form.

The following project, as of 6/2021, was complete for the assignment. The analysis of the project is currently a work in progress; the notebook consists of chunks of written analysis and script.
